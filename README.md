# Rev-Xiao Based on Reviung41 and RevXLP

## Purpose
The primary aim of this project was to create a version of the Reviung41 that uses MX switches with a Xiao controller. However, with the emergence of the Promicro NRF52840 controller from China, which is even cheaper than the Xiao controller, this board is rendered somewhat redundant.

## Using
1. **If you're determined to proceed with this project, please note that it hasn't been tested yet.**
2. You'll need to modify the bottom and upper middle plates of the Reviung41 to accommodate the changes required for the new controller, the shift register, placement of the on/off switch at the back, and connection for the battery at the front.
